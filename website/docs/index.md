# Introduction

## vitest-extended

Additional Vitest matchers

## Problem

Vitest is an amazing test runner and has some awesome assertion APIs built in by default. However, there are times when having more specific matchers (assertions) would be far more convenient.

## Solution

vitest-extended aims to add additional matchers to Vitest's default ones making it easy to test everything ðŸ™Œ

This package is a fork of the wonderful `jest-extended`
